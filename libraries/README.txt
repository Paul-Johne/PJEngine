This folder ("./libraries") contains external libraries which are not included dynamically.
"demo_lib" might be renamed since it holds libraries for all "./applications".

>> UPDATE 29.03.2024
> demo_lib folder was renamed to static_libs
> demo_lib holds libraries for demo.exe
> demoPerformance_lib holds libraries for demoPerformance.exe
